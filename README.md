This repository contains the ppchem project: Hydroponics
Description: Hydroponics is a type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture which involves growing plants, usually crops or medicinal plants, without soil, by using water-based mineral nutrient solutions in an artificial environment. Terrestrial or aquatic plants may grow freely with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid or the roots may be mechanically supported by an inert medium such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates.

Uses: More efficient way of growing crops. Researched as way of growing crops on Mars (Elon Musk) https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/nasa-plant-researchers-explore-question-of-deep-space-food-crops/

Important factors: pH --> depending on plant different pH is needed (in general 6-7) concentration of different salts (enough of some salt, not too much NaCl) solubility ( no precipitation of usefull salts) price (optimize expenses) needs of the plant quantity of salts contained in a plant

Plants: Patato Sweet patato Lettuce (Iceberg, Butterhead) soybeans
