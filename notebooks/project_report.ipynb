    "  The functions present within this package are meant to derive values, generate figures, and a report that can help someone in setting up or running a hydroponic farm. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using water solutions that have an optimal amount of nurtrients instead. It allows for precise control over the plant's environment, resulting in faster growth and higher yields. Important values this package can derive include, the solubility product of a salt, a pH approximation of the solution, which itself uses the derived concentrations of each species of ions within the solution. pH is important in plant growths as growth at an optimal rate only occurs in a small pH range. \n",

    "  If the pH_approximation function were to be fixed and return approximated pH values, these would be quite approximative due to the assumptions made. One being that the complexation of metal ions within the solution does not occur. Complexations lead to the metal ions having a high charge density which would lead to the polarisation of water molecules bound to it, this could lead to a change in the pH of the solution. Additionally, we assume that the water is pure as we set a starting pH of 7, this assumption is more acceptable however as hydroponic farms usually work with distilled water. Adjustements would have to be made otherwise, the pH of the water used would have to be measured beforehand, and the value collected would then need to be used to set new starting concentrations for H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>. Perhaps, an API could be used for the pH approximation instead, though currently, no programs using python or deriving an approximation with the data provided by the other functions we made could be found.\n",
